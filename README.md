### Hi I'm Jan 👋

I'm a software engineer who grew up climbing mountains in a small mountain village.<br>

- ⚡ I've spent the last 5 years building data platforms and MLOps stack<br>
for data collection, annotation, training, and validation in the area of autonomous cars 🌍
- 👪 I believe in starting with the end in mind and working backward to the solution. In starting with the user. The solution follows.
- 📝 P.S. The repo structure was recently (2.5.) simplified for better readability into the 3 main series that I develop in my free time. <br>Might take me few days to polish things.
