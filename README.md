### Hi I'm Jan

I'm a software engineer, writer, and builder. <br>
I grew up climbing mountains in a small mountain village.<br> What I learned since that serves now to others. 

- 🔭 I've spent last 5 years building solutions for data collection, annotation, training, and validation in area of autonomous cars 🌍
- 👪 I believe in starting with the end in mind and working backward to the solution. In starting with the user. The solution follows.
- 📝 P.S. The repo structure was recently (2.5.) simplified for better readability into the 3 main series that I write in my free time. <br>Might take me few days to polish things.
