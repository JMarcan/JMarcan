### Hi I'm Jan

I'm software engineer focused on machine learning in production and its data management

- 🔭 I've spent last 5 years building solutions for data collection, annotation, training, and validation in area of autonomous cars 🌍
- 👪 While designing software, I believe in starting with the customer in mind and working backward to get to the right solution.
- ☁️ My favorite apps run in cloud, are dockerized, and covered by CI/CD pipelines
- 😅 Fun fact: My way to software engineering was pretty straight-forward. In 2012 I build my first robotic car. While software part was fun. The DYI hardware blessed me, right before each demo, with an opportunity to resolder a new cold junction. I learned quickly that I better stay with software
